# Candidate Search App

## Description
This app searches for a list of potential candidates for an IT position on GitHub, and then displays the candidate's Github information for the user. The user can then add or remove candidates from a database. Once satisfied with the first review. The user can then see all the candidates that they marked as potential candidates in a large table, from there they can see the basic necessary information about the candidates, and remove them if necessary.

After you have enough candidates, you can then review candidates you've selected in the Potential Candidates page, and remove them from there if necessary. See the second image below for a preview of the interface.
